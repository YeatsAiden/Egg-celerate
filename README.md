# Egg-celerate
Egg-celerate is the game I am presenting for the Pygame-community spring game jam for 2023
# Libraries
The only extra library besides pygame that will be needed for this game to work is pytmx.
# Controls
Mouse, W, A, S, D, space bar and arrow keys.
Mouse is for throwing eggs.
# Edite:
I plan on updating the game in the future to make it less punishing and sadistic ;]
